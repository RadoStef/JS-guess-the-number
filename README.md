# JS-guess-the-number
<h3> Another game written on JS. Basically it is a project, from Jonas Schmedtmann`s javascript course. Here I used only the idea, and some part of the design. There are also more different logics and functionalities added by me. </h3>
<p> Things that are different from the original game:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Hint button which can be used everytime after number guessing </li>
  <li> Save and load buttons, responsible for saving your highScore to the local storage</li>
  <li> Different animations after winning or loosing the game</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p> The game code will be improved. There are some small thing on the code and css that I have to fix.</p>
<p> At this moment it is what it is ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Have fun reading reading the code, or playing the game! ‚ò∫</p>
